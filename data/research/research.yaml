    What are the long-term economic effects of a more equal distribution of wealth? We exploit variation in historical inheritance rules for land traversing political, linguistic, geological, and religious borders in Germany. In some German areas, inherited land was to be shared or divided equally among children, while in others land was ruled to be indivisible. Using a geographic regression discontinuity design, we show that equal division of land led to a more equal distribution of land; other potential drivers of growth are smooth at the boundary and equal division areas were not historically more developed. Today, equal division areas feature higher average incomes and a right-shifted skill, income, and wealth distribution. Higher top incomes and top wealth in equal division areas coincide with higher education, and higher labor productivity. We show evidence consistent with the more even distribution of land leading to more innovative industrial by-employment during Germany’s transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy and, in the longrun, more entrepreneurship.

  abstract: >
    To assess the substitutability between workers within a firm, and between incumbent workers and outsiders, we estimate how exogenous worker exits aect a firm’s demand for incumbent workers and new hires. Using matched employer-employee data from Germany, we analyze the eects of 34,000 unexpected worker deaths and show that these worker exits on average raise the remaining workers’ wages and retention probabilities for a period of several years. The average eect masks substantial heterogeneity: Coworkers in the same occupation as the deceased see positive wage eects; coworkers in other occupations instead experience wage decreases when a high-skilled worker or manager dies. Finally, when the external labor market in the deceased’s occupation is thin, incumbents’ wages respond more and external hiring responds less to a worker death. Taken together, our findings imply that incumbent workers are closer substitutes to one another compared to outsiders, that high-skilled workers and managers are complements to coworkers in other occupations, and that thin external markets for skills lead to higher firm-specificity of human capital and lower replaceability of incumbents.
