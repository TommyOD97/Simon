## Hello!

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 

My research focuses on the intersection of behavioral and development economics. I examine previously neglected correlates of poverty, including substance abuse, physical pain, sleep deprivation, and depression. I seek to understand the role of these factors in the lives of the poor by studying their impacts on cognitive function, decision-making, and worker productivity. I also study the generation and diffusion of information about optimal agricultural inputs in sub-Saharan Africa.

I received my PhD in economics from Harvard University. I received a diploma in economics from Mannheim University and an MA in economics from the University of California, Berkeley.
